This is what a list of added movies in our database looks like, and here, admin has the possibility to edit, save or delete every movie from that list.

As an interactive accessory, we added a simple game which is activated by clicking the name of the site in the top left corner of the website and then another click on the tab itself, where the game actually takes place.
